## 🧩 What is the Travelling Salesman Problem?

The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) asks: Given a list of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting point? It’s a fundamental problem in computer science and optimization, known for its complexity as the number of cities grows.

Our solver implements several advanced algorithms to approach this problem and visualizes how each method finds a solution.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔍 **Multiple Algorithms Included:**  
  - **Brute Force:** Checks all possible routes to find the absolute shortest (computationally expensive).  
  - **Dynamic Programming:** Uses optimal substructure to prune the search space for efficient exact solutions.  
  - **Genetic Algorithm:** Mimics natural selection processes to evolve good routes over generations.  
  - **Simulated Annealing:** Applies probabilistic techniques to escape local minima and improve solutions.

- 🗺️ **Two Visualization Modes:**  
  - **Real-World Maps:** Powered by **Leaflet.js** for geographic context and realistic exploration.  
  - **Canvas Graphics:** Clean, abstract visuals for custom animations and algorithm tracking.

- 📥 **Data Handling:** Easily import and export city datasets in JSON format for flexibility.

- ⚙️ **Interactive Controls:** Tweak algorithm parameters, pause/resume animations, and watch the solving process step-by-step.

- 📱 **Responsive UI:** Designed to work seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.
